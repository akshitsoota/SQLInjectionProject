# SQL Injection Project
As a part of an Independent Study Project (ISP) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), I was suppose to design a mini project to test students on their SQL Injection concepts.

To try out this project on a LAMP-configured system with `git` installed, execute the following commands:
```shell
cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/akshitsoota/SQLInjectionProject.git
```

Finally, open a browser and visit: [http://localhost/SQLInjectionProject/phase1.php](http://localhost/SQLInjectionProject/phase1.php)
